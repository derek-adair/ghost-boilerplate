# Ghost Boilerplate
How I pre configure my ghost pojects

## Basically;
1. Docker + Compose files (with .env example)
2. More practical `.gitignore`
3. Route `/` to a `page`, not a list of posts.

## TODO
* Seed database w/ my user/password
* Include my base theme, [slimer](https://github.com/derek-adair/slimer)
